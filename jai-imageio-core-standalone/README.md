jai-imageio-core-standalone 
===========================

NOTE: This is a 'standalone' version of
[jai-imageio-core](https://java.net/projects/jai-imageio-core/) where
dependencies to jai-core (javax.media.jai) has been removed. This
version also does not include any of the C implementations from libJIIO,
meaning that this version is platform independent and fully
redistributable under the 3-clause BSD license in LICENSE.txt (and thus
is GPL compatible).

There is **NO FURTHER DEVELOPMENT** in this repository; any commits here are
just to keep the build working with recent versions of Maven/Java - the
date in the version number indicates the time of such modifications
and should not have any effect on functionality.

If you are not concerned about GPL compatibility or source code
availability, you might instead want to use
https://github.com/geosolutions-it/imageio-ext/ which is actively
maintained and extends the original imageio with many useful features,
but depends on the [binary distribution of jai_core](
http://download.osgeo.org/webdav/geotools/javax/media/jai_core/1.1.3/).
